<p>Now that we have gathered our knowledgebase, it is time to quiz ourselves on our knowledge.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)  # For data transformation / reshaping

wikitable &lt;- fread(&quot;wikitable.tsv&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># Function to clean sentences by removing some non-alphanumeric characters and removing if it&#39;s a &quot;common&quot; word

        .[nchar(.) &gt; 0]
}</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># Total unique words across all protein function descriptions

<p>It works! But - we can cheat by simply typing words that are common in the English language:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>quiz()
# &gt; What do you know about Dermatopontin?
# &gt; it do be like as if in a cell
# &gt; &quot;Good job! Your score: 99.96&quot;</code></pre>

<p>Back to Wikipedia!</p>

<p>And let’s update our ‘clean’ function</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Also remove &quot;common&quot; words

<p>Okay, we are ready for the second attempt.</p>

    # Note: The proper usage of phyper is with arguments: q-1, m, n-m, k
    # However, by using k we give an unproportionally high score if the player is lazy and gives a short answer.

    # as the expected length of the response.

<p>Let’s try the same protein and give the same response as previously…</p>
<pre class="r"><code>quiz(protein = &quot;dermatopontin&quot;)
# &gt; What do you know about Dermatopontin?
# &gt; it do be like as if in a cell
# &gt; &quot;Work harder! Your score: 29.42&quot;</code></pre>
<p>We get some points for knowing ‘cell’ but it’s still an F. Let’s try again with a better response.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>quiz(protein = &quot;dermatopontin&quot;)
# &gt; What do you know about Dermatopontin?
# &gt; enhances tgfb1 activity and accelerates collagen formation
# &gt; &quot;Good job! Your score: 99.94&quot;</code></pre>

<h3>Conclusion - Part 2</h3>
<p>We cleaned up the output from Part 1 and used it as content for a small game. A quiz, that utilized a probability distribution to determine if the player’s description of a protein was better or worse than a set of randomly drawn words from the population.</p>
<p>In Part 3 we will attempt to generalize the concept, and create <em>the omni-quiz</em>.</p>
